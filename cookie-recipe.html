    <h3>History of cookies</h3>
    <p>
      Most people don't know the hilarious and bewildering past of the cookie.
      They were invented during a pre-destination paradox by a chef from the
      last 21st Century stranded in the 12th. Upon tasting them, people asked
      "These are delicious! How did you make them!?" and, without thinking, she
      casually responded "Easy". Thus they became known as 'cook-easy', but the
      'y' was eventually dropped, resulting in the now-known "cook-ease".
